## Hi there

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This is the central location for all API standardization recommendations developed under the patronage of the Common API initiative of Swiss Fintech Innovations (SFTI).
In addition to the API specs, you will also find a wiki with further information (business requirements, use cases, etc.) in the respective repository.

Further documentation underlying these APIs may be found on the <a href="https://c-a-p-s.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUB/overview" target="_blank">Confluence site of the Common API Initiative</a>. Please note that our goal is to consolidate all our work results on GitHub, so the Confluence content will decrease to zero over time.
