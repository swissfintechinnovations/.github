## Hi there

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->
This is the central location for all API standardization recommendations developed under the patronage of the [Common API](https://swissfintechinnovations.ch/projects/common-api/) initiative of Swiss Fintech Innovations ([SFTI](https://swissfintechinnovations.ch)).
In addition to the API spec, each repository also contains a wiki with further information (business requirements, use cases, etc.).

Basic information valid for all APIs is located in a dedicated [Github wiki](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/.github/wiki). There you can also find an introduction to the Common API working group and what we do.

Currently, we are covering the following business areas.
  - XS2A/Payments (repo [ca-payment](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-payment))
  - Mortgage (repo [ca-mortgage](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-mortgage))
  - Wealth (repo [ca-wealth](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-wealth))
  - Card (repo [ca-card](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-card))
  - Pension (repo [ca-pension](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-pension))
  - API Security and Consent Management (repo [ca-security](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-security))

Furthermore, there are also general repositories that support all business areas.
  - cross-sectional topics (repo [ca-shared](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-shared))
  - organisation maintenance and infrstructure (repo [.github](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/.github))

In addition, we are in constant information exchange with the following organizations regarding the proliferation of standardization recommendations for APIs for the Swiss financial center:
  - EcoHub, the API-based platform connecting insurance companies and insurance brokers:
    - [Confluence](https://ecohubag.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DP/overview?mode=global)
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/EcoHub-AG)

Please note that the API specifications developed by the organizations mentioned in the latter section are not necessarily based on SFTI's API design recommendations.

**Collaboration**

If you are interested in providing feedback, please visit the Common API website mentioned above. There, you will find the information necessary to contact us.

To actively participate in individual streams, please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file of the respective stream repository. A good starting point for contributing changes to APIs via pull requests is our [How to Start & Contribute](https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/.github/wiki/How-to-Start-&-Contribute) wiki page.

> [!NOTE]
> SFTI's standardization recommendations for APIs can be implemented individually at each interested FI. At least for some APIs, the leading implementation is currently realized in coordination with the Open Banking platform [bLink](https://blink.six-group.com/) of SIX. In the repos of the affected APIs, this is explicitly stated.
