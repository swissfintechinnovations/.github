## Hi there

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->
<p>This is the central location for all API standardization recommendations developed under the patronage of the <a href="https://common-api.ch/index.php/en">Common API</a> initiative of Swiss Fintech Innovations (<a href="https://swissfintechinnovations.ch">SFTI</a>).
In addition to the API spec, each repository also contains a wiki with further information (business requirements, use cases, etc.).

<p>Basic information valid for all APIs is located in a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/.github/wiki">wiki</a>.

<p>More documentation underlying these APIs may be found on the <a href="https://c-a-p-s.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUB/overview" target="_blank">Confluence space</a> of the Common API Initiative. Please note that our goal is to consolidate all our work results on GitHub, so the Confluence content will decrease to zero over time.

<p>Currently, we are covering the following business areas.
<ul>
  <li>XS2A/Payments (repo <a href="https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-payment">ca-payments</a>)</li>
  <li>Mortgage (repo <a href="https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-mortgage">ca-mortgage</a>)</li>
  <li>Wealth (repo <a href="https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-wealth">ca-wealth</a>)</li>
  <li>Card (repo <a href="https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-card">ca-card</a>)</li>
  <li>Pension (repo <a href="https://github.com/swissfintechinnovations/ca-pension">ca-pension</a>)</li>
</ul>
